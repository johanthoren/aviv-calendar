# -- BEGINNING OF INTRO: -- #

# A SHORT DESCRIPTION:
# Aviv Calendar, a small program to find out what day it is according
# to the Biblical calendar. Also attempts to let you know about
# the Feasts of the Lord as well as the Sabbath.

# CURRENT STATUS:
# Currently, it only decides what day of week, month and year it is according
# to biblical timekeeping. It will also tell you some details about sunset
# and sunrise and wether or not is is a weekly sabbath.
