# the Feasts of the Lord as well as the Sabbath.

# biblical timekeeping. It will also tell you some details about
# sunset and sunrise and wether or not is is a weekly sabbath.

# This file contains some baseline months where gregorian time and
# biblical time can be defined for sure based on real observations.

# The format for the value is a tuple of the following:
# BIBLICAL year, BIBLICAL month, GREGORIAN year of the first day of the
# BIBLICAL month (the GREGORIAN day on which the sunset signaled the new
# day), GREGORIAN month of that same day, GREGORIAN day of said day.
